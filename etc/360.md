# Interpreting the 360° Video

An outdoor 360° surveillance camera operated by Twin Peaks Tavern captured the entire accident—from the pedestrians entering the crosswalk up to 14 seconds early, to my entering the intersection on a yellow, to the actual impact and everything that happened between and afterward.

The prosecutors misinterpresed the evidence therein and tried to use it against me, both directly in court and also by leaking false information about the video to the media.

This video—seized by the police and moved into evidence by the prosecution—was our greatest defensive tool and it's probably the only reason I didn't get a sentence that included the jailtime prosecutors wanted.

## Split-screen View

The video has two "screens," one on top of the other, as shown below.

The image on the top actually belongs on the right, to complete the 360° view one might expect, shown below.

## Compass Directions
I've added approximate compass directions in yellow letters. The arrows don't line up at right angles because the parts of the scene that travel throught the edges of the camera's lenses get distorted, especially farther from the camera's physical location (marked by a red letter "C").

## Bicycle's Path and Location of Accident
I also drew a blue line showing my bicycle's path southbound on Castro Street to where I encountered a group of pedestrians I could not avoid (marked by a blue letter "A").

## Timing
In the original video, everything important happens in around three seconds, so it's way too fast to be useful in that form. Plus, it was very low-res, recorded at only 6.2 frames per second. There is a clock in the upper right corner, but it only displays whole seconds, which doesn't offer enough precision for the kind of analysis done in court and herein.

[Still frames from the video](/rebuttals/walk_symbol.md) provide the only way to analyze the video effectively.
