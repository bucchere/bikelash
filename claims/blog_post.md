# The "blog post"
A week after the accident (and three days after Mr. Hui's death), reports surfaced that a deleted online post in Mission Cycling's forums, written by me, contained details about the accident.

I did write those words, but in my drug-addled state and after a head injury, I thought I was sending an [email](/rebuttals/blog_post.md) that was only going to my family, a few close friends, and my Mission Cycling teammates.

The email was copied-and-pasted into different online forums until it eventually became ubiquitous enough to be considered a "blog post." Only a few articles correctly traced its origin back to an email.

News media and bloggers took several phrases from the email out of context ("[plowed through the crowded crosswalk](http://sfist.com/2012/04/05/cyclist_who_struck_pedestrian_at_ca.php)," "[laid it down](http://blog.sfgate.com/bicycle/2012/04/11/bucchere-cycling-post-so-i-laid-it-down/)," etc.)

However, by far the most deceptive slight of hand was changing the chronology to make it seem like I had written the "blog post" _after_ Mr. Hui had died. This facilitated a [new story](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2290592/Bicyclist-accused-killing-71-year-old-dedicating-incident-broken-helmet-face-gross-vehicular-manslaughter-charges.html) about how I was clearly and publicly mourning my helmet _instead_ of the man I had "killed," conveniently alterting the chronology and turning obvious allegory about helmet safety into fact to facilitate a clever headline.

_That_ story, after making a sharp detour from anything that happened in real life, went internationally viral. Yahoo! News wrote [a story about how big of a story it was](https://www.yahoo.com/news/blogs/upshot/cyclist-accident-makes-waves-181534779.html).
