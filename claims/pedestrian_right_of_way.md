# Pedestrians always have the right of way
Several sections of the California Vehicle Code [prove it false both in letter and in spirit](/rebuttals/pedestrian_right_of_way.md); nonetheless, this seven-word phrase represents part of our collective (mis)understanding of the rules of the road.

To what extent do people believe in this myth? To help answer that question, I created a [Google consumer survey](https://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/view?survey=c2ydxpcngiiig).

## Survey says

The statistically-significant result indicates that about three out of every four internet-enabled adult Californians believe in the fallacy that pedestrians always have the right of way.

Though not entirely responsible for this phenominon, I noticed two marketing campaigns—run by well-meaning San Francisco organizations—that use messaging designed to support this myth.

## SF Vision Zero
I took this photo in December of 2014 on Lombard Street. Signs like this one were posted in prominent locations throughout the city as well as on hundreds of Muni busses. A now-defunt [website](http://safestreetssf.org) accompanied the signage; [this SFMTA page](https://www.sfmta.com/blog/safe-streets-sf) outlines some of the supposed merits of this program.

The creators of the signs and web site could plausibly deny that they are claiming pedestrians *always* have *the* right of way because they left out of the words *always* and *the*. And they are correct: Pedestrians do have right of way, *sometimes*. These sorts of subtleties, however, are undoubtedly lost on drivers who only have time for a cursory glance at the signs, reinforcing a lie that three-quarters of us already believe.

## San Francisco Bicycle Coalition
In the "[Rules of the Road](http://www.sfbike.org/resources/bicycle-law/rules-of-the-road/)," according to the city's Bicycle Coalition, the first rule claims that "PEDESTRIANS HAVE THE RIGHT OF WAY" and futhermore that: "In the crosswalk or not, bike riders and drivers are required to yield to pedestrians." While both those sentiments sound like well-intentioned advice for preventing harm on our roadways, they are both demonstrably false.

Each of the the Bicycle Coalition's so-called "Rules of the Road" links to related sections of state and municipal code. In an attempt to bolster their claims about pedestrian right of way, they cite California Vehicle Code  [§21954](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&sectionNum=21954.)(b), which states:

```
The provisions of this section shall not relieve the driver of a vehicle from the duty
to exercise due care for the safety of any pedestrian upon a roadway.
```

However, they neglect to mention provision (a) of the stame statute, the reciprocal part of that code that requires pedestrians to *yield* the right of way to vehicles whenever entering the roadway in a dangerous fashion:

```
Every pedestrian upon a roadway at any point other than within a marked crosswalk or within
an unmarked crosswalk at an intersection shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles upon the
roadway so near as to constitute an immediate hazard.
```

This section, taken as a whole, states that drivers (including cyclists) must exercise caution while at the same time it explicitly limits pedestrian right of way.

CVC§21954 is one of a [handful of sections of the vehicle code](/rebuttals/pedestrian_right_of_way.md) that define exactly when, where, and how pedestrian right of way is either granted or yielded based upon the disposition of the WALK/DON'T WALK indicator and a number of other situational factors.

# Conclusion
Generally speaking, roads are dangerous—for everyone who uses them. We shouldn't make them more so by advertising folklore over law.

As it pertained to my accident: By playing into mass-misperceptions about pedestrian right of way, the media crafted a storyline that made me look guilty from the start. This also created an opportunity for the District Attorney to address the [public's anger and fear about bicycles](/claims/rules_of_the_road.md) by crafting a message about two exceptionally-rare fatal bike/pedestrian accidents that occurred within a span of nine months.
