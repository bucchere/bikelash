# Cyclists flaunt the rules of the road

Bikelash, the public outrage directed at cyclists—not to be confused with [_Bikelash_](https://medium.com/bikelash), the podcast—is a very real danger to cyclists of all types. Whether driven by anger/road-rage, fear, or something else entirely, most people, especially here in the San Francisco Bay Area, really despise cyclists.

One explanation is that people feel cyclists get to use the road without being held accountable when they break the law.

I ran another Google Survey, which showed that, in a statistically-significant sample of adult, internet-enabled respondants, 57.8% of Californians believes cyclists don't usually follow the rules of the road.

## Sample size of one
This comment, written in response to the first story about me in the _Chronicle_, was representative of the sentiment of most of the others:

> “Bicycle riders VERY rarely obey the traffic laws. I avoid Market Street and the downtown area, but normal everyday cyclists ignore stop signs, lights, right of ways, etc. They think they own the road and always should have the right of way. They cut you off and then flip you off if you disagree with them. Some are curious, but not many!!!! Furthermore, I have NEVER seen a cyclists pulled over getting a ticket for anything! Do they ever get tickets for flying through stop signs, or red lights?” —gldretlvr 

## Really, though?
For every bike commuter on the road, there is likely one less car, less congestion, fewer carbon emmissions, and one more open parking spot. Bikes rarely cause harm to anyone or anything. They also rarely impede the flow of traffic, especially when there's good infrastructure to support cycling. As more people get out of cars and on to bikes (and other forms of alternative transporation, including walking), [cities get safer for everyone](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/04/17/actually-cyclists-make-city-streets-safer/?utm_term=.bec00d723e47). 

## So then why is bikelash a thing?
Many have attempted to explain this counter-intuitive phenominon. Some say it's related to fear of causing harm to cyclists. Some say it's a factor of confirmation bias, i.e. only noticing the bad behaviors and minimizing the good ones. Some say it's because drivers feel disconnected from the road while inside their vehicles.

Others claim that [people stereotype and over-generalize groups (cyclists) to which they don't belong](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2012/09/cyclists_are_annoying_why_you_think_they_re_a_menace_on_two_wheels_.html), because most adults drive, but very few ride bikes.

## Conclusion
Bikelash came full circle for me. First, it caused my fault in this accident to be taken for granted. Soon after, I became a citation for arguments of why bikelash exists in the Bay Area in the first place.
