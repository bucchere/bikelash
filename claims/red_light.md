In their first story about the accident, the San Francisco Chronicle [reported](http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Pedestrian-cyclist-injured-in-crash-in-Castro-3444305.php) that a Fire Department Spokeswoman said:

> According to police, the male cyclist was traveling south on Castro and crossing Market when he struck the man, who was walking eastbound in the crosswalk. The bicyclist may have run a red light, according to witnesses, policeÂ said.

The witness statements in the police report contained vague and conflicting accounts of the many different signal lights in the intersection, their colors and my location versus the pedestrians'.

In spite of conflicting media accounts as to the color of my light, a red light violation was one of the three components of my felony vehicular manslaughter charge.
