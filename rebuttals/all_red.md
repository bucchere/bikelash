# All red
The signals for vehicle and pedestrian traffic at Market & Castro fire in a constant-timed sequence that includes a 3.5-second yellow phase and a 3.5-second "all red" phase.

This "all red" (or "delayed green" as it is sometimes called) should have prevented all vehicle and pedestrian traffic from entering the intersection by delaying the appearance of the green light and WALK symbol for 3.5 seconds after the red light is first shown.

San Francisco Police Department Captain Rick Casciato [told KCBS](http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2012/03/29/cyclist-pedestrian-hurt-in-sf-castro-district-bicycle-collision/) that â€œthe light had just changed as a 73-year-old man stepped into the crosswalk and the bicyclist entered the intersection."

This strongly implies that pedestrians started crossing right as I first entered the intersection. So, if he's correct, then only one of the following two statements can be true:

1. I caught a late yellow and the pedestrians jumped their WALK indicator by 3.5 seconds, or
2. The pedestrians waited for the WALK and I ran the red by 3.5 seconds.

In light of this, I had a strong suspicion that a group of pedestrians closing in from both sides had caused this accident, despite everything in the media to the contrary, most of which was coming directly from the leaky DA's office or the SFPD.
