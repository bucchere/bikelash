# Failure to Yield to Pedestrians

Based on the widely-misunderstood concept that [pedestrians *do not* always have the right of way](/rebuttals/pedestrian_right_of_way.md), that [my light was yellow](/rebuttals/red_light.md), and that [eight pedestrians crossed against a DON'T WALK symbol](/rebuttals/walk_symbol.md), I never should have been charged with failure to yield.
