# Red Light
From the moment after I gained consciousness onward, I maintained that my light—while a close call—was definitely still yellow when I entered the intersection.

For the first several months following the accident, it was strictly my word against theirs. Then I noticed a traffic light in the prosecutions own video evidence that showed my entering on a late yellow, not a red.

All the lights fire in sequence, so we only needed one of them to show that my light, while very close, was yellow, and that [eight pedestrians crossed early](/rebuttals/crowded_crosswalk.md), one almost fourteen seconds early.

It's very hard to tell my exact position, but in the last frame (the first frame of red), it appears as though my bike has crossed at least one of the white lines demarcating the beginning of the intersection and the northern crosswalk.
