# Crowded crosswalk

At the last moment of the DON'T WALK indicator—just before it turned to WALK—the video camera captured this chilling image. Eight people are shown crossing—seven in the crosswalk and one just north of it, from different directions. One woman has already crossed 75% of the way from the other side, closing the gap between me and the Huis, my bike shown just feet away from Mr. Hui.

# How early did each pedestrian cross?

The number next to each pedestrian indicates, in seconds, how early each pedestrian crossed. [My light was definitely a close call](/rebuttals/red_light.md), but the pedestrians' behavior was the opposite of close.
