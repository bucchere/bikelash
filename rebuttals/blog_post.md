# The "blog post"

Six hours after the accident, while suffering from a head injury and taking painkillers, I thought it was a good idea to email my family, friends and former Mission Cycling teammates to let them know what happened: that a pedestrian was hurt, that I was mostly okay, and that I probably would have died if I hadn't been wearing my helmet.

Moments before writing the email, I had just gotten off the phone with the police, who told me that Mr. Hui was expected to make a full recovery.

Because of my head injury, my emotional state (likely still in shock) and the powerful drugs, the email was long and rambling. It sounded loopy, almost delirious. It had three glaring typos, including miss-stating what street I was bicycling on. It also went to more people than I had intended, because I didn't know the Mission Cycling email list had hundreds of people on it who never rode with the team.

To be clear: When I wrote this email, no one had died or was even expected to die. I also didn't know that I was going to be in the news, let alone become an international viral meme. Had Mr. Hui lived, the email would have been seen as nothing more than a story about how a helmet saved my life, not unlike [this one](https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/32455694/i-thought-i-was-going-to-die-helmet-saves-billionaire-richard-branson/#page1) or many others like it.

This is what the email said, in its entirety.

The light turned yellow as I was approaching the intersection, but I was already way too committed to stop. The light turned red as I was cruising through the middle of the intersection and then, almost instantly, the southern crosswalk on Market and Castro filled up with people coming from both directions. The intersection very long and the width of Castro Street at that point is very short, so, in a nutshell, blammo.

It was commuter hour and it was crowded as all getup. I couldn’t see a line through the crowd and I couldn’t stop, so I laid it down and just plowed through the crowded crosswalk in the least-populated place I could find.

Apparently I hit a 71-year old male pedestrian and he ended up in the ICU with pretty serious head injuries. I really hope he ends up OK.

Like the Secret Service would do for a president, she took some serious pavement today, cracking through-and-through in five places and getting completely mauled by the ragged asphalt. May she die knowing that because she committed the ultimate sacrifice, her rider can live on and ride on. Can I get an amen?

## Conclusion

It goes without saying that the mock-dedication at the end of my email was nothing more than a head-injury-and-drug-induced allegory meant solely to advise other cyclists to wear their helmets. I used humor to shield my true emotions and hide that I was feeling fragile, vulnerable, and grateful that a helmet had probably saved my life. Obviously sending it was a bad decision made by someone not thinking clearly after a head injury. However, there is no excuse for reporters who intentionally took it literally in order to create a click-baiting headline.

All the stories about comparing my helmet's mock "death" to Mr. Hui's real death are complete hogwash. At the time I wrote the email, Mr. Hui was alive and reportedly [expected to survive](http://archives.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/pedestrian-injured-in-collision-with-bicyclist-expected-to-survive/Content?oid=2196979) the accident. And I can't believe I have to say this, but I don't actually think that helmets are living things, no more so than Lewis Carroll thought that rabbits carry pocketwatches.
