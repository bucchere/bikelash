# Mr. "Several Red Lights and Stop Signs" fabricated his entire testimony

His account, which already defied the laws of motion, had us leapfrogging down the Castro Street hill, where somehow I overtook him twice(!), then also flew by him while he was stopped at the red light at Market Street.

The clock in the video shows his car approching the north end of the accident and stopping at around 8:02:47. The accident took place at approximately 8:02:17, which disproved everything he said.

By following the red arrow and watching the [360° video](/etc/360.md)'s clock, it's easy to see that [his vehicle, a gray and black Honda Element, arrives at the north end of the intersection thirty seconds after the accident](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/bikelash/castro_market_chris_bucchere_accident_nathan_pollak.gif).

Nathan also claimed that I and another cyclist did not stop at _any_ red lights or stop signs as he was supposedly stalking us as we rode on Castro Street from Duboce Street to Market Street. GPX waypoints collected by the Strava application on my iPhone proved that my riding partner and I stopped for 12 seconds at the 14th Street stop light.

The 15th street light was on a timed sequence that causes it to turn green shortly thereafter. We gently rolled the 16th Street stop sign in tandem with a car—not Nathan's—because he was nowhere near us at any point before the accident. Based on his arrival time at Market Street, it would have been physically impossible for him ever to have seen us as we rode on Castro Street.
