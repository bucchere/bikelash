# Pedestrian Right-of-Way is Situation-Dependent

According to [§21963](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&sectionNum=21963) of the California Vehicle Code, pedestrians always have the right-of-way if they are blind and walking with the assistance of a white cane or a guide dog (or both).

Under all other circumstances, pedestrian right-of-way depends on a variety of conditions as spelled out by CVC [§21950](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&sectionNum=21950.), [§21953](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&sectionNum=21953.), [§21954](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&sectionNum=21954.), [§21955](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&sectionNum=21955.), and [§21456](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&sectionNum=21456.).

Those sections decribe when it is and when it is not lawful for pedestrians to cross the street, the regulations regarding the use of crosswalks or intersections, as well as pedestrians' duty not to step directly into traffic so as to consitute an "immediate hazard" to vehicle operators (including cyclists). 

Many of the sections are reciprocal, i.e. they ask that "due care" be taken by both cars and pedestrians to avoid accidents, but by no means do any of the sections grant pedestrians universal right of way.
