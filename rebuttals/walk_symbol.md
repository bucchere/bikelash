# WALK Symbol
Using the following frames from the prosecutor's video, it's easy to tell that eight pedestrians crossed against a DON'T WALK symbol, putting themselves and me in harm's way.

Nearly one second into the N/S yellow cycle and six seconds before the WALK indicator, two pedestrians nearly get hit by a northbound car traveling through the yellow light as they sneak around the 24 Divisidero bus. They jump back out of the way and then begin to cross again.

This is the last frame of the 3.5-second yellow cycle. Pedestrians 1, 2 and 3 are in motion, walking west at a brisk pace.

Exactly 3.5 seconds after the N/S yellow cycle began, the light changes to red. After a 3.5 delay, the E/W walk indicator will change from DON'T WALK to WALK, giving north and southbound vehicles time to clear the intersection before the pedestrians are allowed to cross in the opposing direction.

Exactly 2.5 seconds before the walk indicator turns on, Mr. Hui steps off the curb and begins to cross from the west side of Castro Street. Pedestrians 1 and 2 are making their way toward the center line, but still in
the northbound lane.

At exactly one second before the walk indicator turns to WALK, Mrs. Hui follows Mr. Hui off the curb and into the crosswalk. The bicycle can be seen crossing the train tracks on Market Street. Pedestrian 1 crosses the center line and enters the southbound lane, heading directly into the path of the bicycle.

Two frames before the accident, with the walk indicator still reading DON'T WALK, the bicycle is in the crosswalk, leaning sharply to the east. There are a total of eight pedestrians crossing, three occupying the soutbound lane (same as the bicycle) -- pedestrian 1 and Mr. and Mrs. Hui.

The WALK indicator turns on, exactly seven seconds after the green cycle ended. This is exactly the last frame (about one sixth of a second) before impact.
